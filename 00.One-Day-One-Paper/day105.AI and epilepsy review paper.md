AI 기법을 사용해서 epilepsy 증상인 seizure을 탐지하고 예측할 수 있는가? 에 관한 리뷰 페이퍼

1) Automated detection of interictal epileptiform discharges(IED)

- IED : spikes, polyspikes, sharp waves, or spike and slow-wave complexes without observed clinical seizures
- Automatic IED detection 할 필요가 있다.
- a CNN to detect IEDs on human scalp EEG recordings
- SpikeNet : automatically detect IEDs -> AUROC 0.980 binary classification
- Both CNN and LSTM to detect IEDs -> AUROC 0.940 binary classification
- etc

2) Seizure detection

- Automated seizure detectors can be used in continuous monitoring
- CNN to detect seizures on humans scalp EEG recordings -> The multichannel EEG time series were converted into window-based images. -> True positive rate 74.0%
- models based on both 1D and 2D CNN -> accuracy 99.02%
- etc

3) Seizure forecasting

- If we can accurately recognize upcoming seizures in less than a minute, we can prevent injuries that result from falls or body stiffening.
- CNN based predict seizures in EEG -> sensitivity CHB-MIT(81.2%) Freiburg Hospital(81.4%) Kaggle(75.0%)
- DCGAN-based classification models -> AUROC 0.777 and 0.755
- etc

꽤 기본적인 모델을 사용했네..? transformer도 사용해도 되지 않을까 싶다.
