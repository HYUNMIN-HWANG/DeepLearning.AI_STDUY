## 1. Machine Learning
This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition.    
Topics include:     
(i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).     
(ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning).     
(iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).    
- Instructor : Andrew Ng
